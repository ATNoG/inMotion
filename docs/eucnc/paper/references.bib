  abstract       = {Automatic passenger counting (APC) systems in public transport are useful in collecting information that can help improve the efficiency of transport networks. Focusing on video-based passenger counting, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare an existing APC system, claimed by its manufacturer to be highly accurate (98%), with a newly developed low-cost APC system operating under the same real-world conditions. For this comparison, a low-cost APC system using a Raspberry Pi with a camera and a YOLOv5 object detection algorithm was developed, and an in-field experiment was performed in collaboration with the public transport companies operating in the cities of Turin and Asti in Italy. The experiment shows that the low-cost system was able to achieve an accuracy of 72.27% and 74.59%, respectively, for boarding and alighting, while the tested commercial APC system had an accuracy, respectively, of 53.11% and 55.29%. These findings suggest that current APC systems might not meet expectations under real-world conditions, while low-cost systems could potentially perform at the same level of accuracy or even better than very expensive commercial systems.},

  abstract       = {Since the early stages of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), one of the application scenarios that have been affected the most by this new paradigm is mobility. Smart Cities have greatly benefited from the awareness of some people’s habits to develop efficient mobility services. In particular, knowing how people use public transportation services and move throughout urban infrastructure is crucial in several areas, among which the most prominent are tourism and transportation. Indeed, especially for Public Transportation Companies (PTCs), long- and short-term planning of the transit network requires having a thorough knowledge of the flows of passengers in and out vehicles. Thanks to the ubiquitous presence of Internet connections, this knowledge can be easily enabled by sensors deployed on board of public transport vehicles. In this paper, a Wi-Fi-based Automatic Bus pAssenger CoUnting System, named iABACUS, is presented. The objective of iABACUS is to observe and analyze urban mobility by tracking passengers throughout their journey on public transportation vehicles, without the need for them to take any action. Test results proves that iABACUS efficiently detects the number of devices with an active Wi-Fi interface, with an accuracy of 100% in the static case and almost 94% in the dynamic case. In the latter case, there is a random error that only appears when two bus stops are very close to each other.},

  abstract       = {With the development of technologies and the growing need for accurate positioning inside buildings, the localization method based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting is becoming increasingly popular. Its popularity is explained by the relative simplicity of implementation, low cost and the ability to use existing wireless infrastructure. This review article covers all the key aspects of building such systems: from the wireless communication technology and the creation of a radiomap to data preprocessing methods and model training using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Specific recommendations are provided for each stage that can be useful for both researchers and practicing engineers. Particular attention is paid to such important issues as RSSI signal instability, the impact of multipath propagation, differences between devices and system scalability issues. In conclusion, the review highlights the most promising areas for further research. For smart cities, the approaches and recommendations presented in the review contribute to the development of urban services by combining indoor positioning systems with IoT platforms for automation, transport and energy management.},

Therefore, it is crucial in areas such as public safety, transportation, urban planning, disaster and crisis management, and mass events organization, both for the adoption of appropriate policies and measures and for the development of advanced services and applications. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive privacy-preserving detection of people’s presence and movement patterns by tracking their carried WiFi-enabled personal devices, using the network management messages transmitted by these devices for their association with the available networks. However, due to privacy regulations, various randomization schemes have been implemented in network management messages to prevent easy discrimination between devices based on their addresses, sequence numbers of messages, data fields, and the amount of data contained in the messages. To this end, we proposed a novel de-randomization method that detects individual devices by grouping similar network management messages and corresponding radio channel characteristics using a novel clustering and matching procedure. The proposed method was first calibrated using a labeled publicly available dataset, which was validated by measurements in a controlled rural and a semi-controlled indoor environment, and finally tested in terms of scalability and accuracy in an uncontrolled crowded urban environment. The results show that the proposed de-randomization method is able to correctly detect more than 96% of the devices from the rural and indoor datasets when validated separately for each device. When the devices are grouped, the accuracy of the method decreases but is still above 70% for rural environments and 80% for indoor environments. The final verification of the non-intrusive, low-cost solution for analyzing the presence and movement patterns of people, which also provides information on clustered data that can be used to analyze the movements of individuals, in an urban environment confirmed the accuracy, scalability and robustness of the method. However, it also revealed some drawbacks in terms of exponential computational complexity and determination and fine-tuning of method parameters, which require further optimization and automation.},
