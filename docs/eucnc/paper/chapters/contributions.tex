\section{Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

This work puts forward the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Novel RSSI-based Movement Classification Framework:} A methodology exploiting temporal RSSI evolution to distinguish static and transitional movement patterns without precise localization.

    \item \textbf{Purpose-Built Experimental Dataset:} Approximately 1,360 labelled samples across four movement classes, collected using four devices under isolated and noisy conditions.

    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Classifier Evaluation:} Comparative analysis of 38 machine learning classifiers with multiple metrics and statistical validation across three random seeds.

    \item \textbf{Feature Importance Analysis:} Identification that initial and mid-trajectory RSSI measurements contribute most to classification accuracy.

    \item \textbf{Privacy-Preserving Approach:} Operation using only aggregate RSSI measurements without device identification or personal data.
\end{enumerate}

Experimental results reaching over 81\% accuracy underscore the practical viability of RSSI-based passenger movement sensing as a cost-effective complement to existing APC technologies.
