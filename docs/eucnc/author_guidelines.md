Paper Submission
High-quality papers, in double-column IEEE format and with 6 pages (maximum 8), are invited.

The conference language is English.

Papers should present the Scientific, Technical and Visionary Research work, and must highlight the novelty as well as actual or expected impact.

All papers using the IEEE Template must be submitted online, as a PDF document. Paper submission is open to all researchers independently of being associated to European Framework projects.

It is a condition of submitting a paper that:

1. the list of authors is not changed after the paper has been submitted for review;
2. following acceptance of papers, authors act on feedback and comments provided by the TPC, prior to submitting the final paper for publication;
3. presenters act on feedback provided by their Session Chair to ensure high quality presentations;
4. presenters register and pay the participant’s fee by the deadline prior to submitting the final version of the paper.

All papers are anonymously reviewed by the Technical Programme Committee (TPC) (i.e., authors are not aware of who the reviewers were).

A notification of acceptance will be sent to the authors.

The Organising Committee may only communicate with the author who submitted the paper, and not with all authors.

Papers will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
• Relevance and timeliness
• Technical content and scientific rigour
• Novelty and originality
• Quality of presentation
• Overall Recommendation

Final papers are subject to editorial review and a quality check.

Papers not selected for oral presentation may be accepted for presentation in poster sessions.
